    """
    A visitor class designed to identify Time-Of-Check to Time-Of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerabilities
    in GitHub workflows that are triggered via workflow dispatch and handle pull request numbers
    without accompanying SHA references.

    TOCTOU vulnerabilities can occur when there is a window of opportunity between the time a
    condition is checked and the time an action is taken based on that condition. This class
    specifically targets workflows that may be susceptible to such vulnerabilities by analyzing
    the paths within the workflow graph.

        Identifies TOCTOU vulnerabilities in workflows that are triggered by workflow dispatch
        events and handle pull request (PR) numbers without accompanying SHA references.

        This method performs the following operations:
        1. Retrieves all nodes tagged with "workflow_dispatch" from the workflow graph.
        2. For each of these nodes, it performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) to find paths
           that lead to nodes tagged with "checkout".
        3. Processes each identified path to determine if it contains potential TOCTOU
           vulnerabilities.
        4. Aggregates and renders the results in an ASCII format for easy visualization.

            graph (TaggedGraph): The workflow graph containing all nodes and their relationships.
            api (Api): An instance of the API wrapper to interact with GitHub APIs.
